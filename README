GeoNote
=======
GeoNote is a simple iOS application targeting iOS 5.0 and above devices that allows you to add notes at your current location and retrieve them later.

Previous notes can be seen on the map around your current location and they can be edited/deleted.

Notes are stored locally on the device using CoreData.
